# Project Description
  
  A burglar alarm system will be installed for the smart home. 
The burglar alarm will be activated through the android application when you leave the house. 
Burglar alarm on-off operation will be done with a button defined on the android application.
Once the alarm is set, the alarm will sound when information is received from a motion sensor (which may be a potentiometer) on the microcontroller. 
An LED will be defined for the alarm,seconds. 
At the same time, in case of alarm, security units will be automatically searched by the application and a mechanism will be set up to send sms to the host. 
The alarm can be turned off both by the application and by a button to be defined on the microcontroller.


Continuous information will be taken from the gas sensor in the house and the system will be alarmed when the gas level goes above the specified level.
In case of alarm, a led to be identified will flash and the natural gas emergency service will be called by the application.
During the alarm, an alarm message will appear on the screen, the phone will vibrate and an SMS will be sent to the host. 
The alarm can be turned off through the application.


The application can be connected to the house remotely (bluetooth) air conditioner and dishwasher can be operated. 
Operation status of these devices and adjustment buttons shall be designed on the application.


In accordance with smart energy systems, the light intensity of the home environment will be adjusted according to the light level of the outdoor environment. 
This part will only be designed on the microcontroller side. 
Remote switching on and off of the home lamp only when in the home environment


Remote opening and closing of the house curtains will be done by the application. 
When the curtains are opened and closed, an LED will be defined on the microcontroller side. 
When the curtains are opened, the led will stay on after flashing for 10 seconds at 1 second intervals.
After the curtain opening and closing state, ìPush messageî feature will be given warning message on android application.


The temperature of the home environment will be measured by a temperature sensor and the temperature value will be displayed continuously on the application screen. 
Control of the ambient temperature shall be ensured. 
There will be two sections on the application: ìCurrent Temperatureî and ìDesired Temperatureî.
The desired temperature section can be changed manually and two buttons will be placed next to this section in the form of "+ and -". 
With the help of these buttons, the desired temperature value can be changed other than entering manually.
When the temperature exceeds the desired value by 1 degree, the air conditioner will be operated, when the room temperature is 2 degrees below the desired temperature, the air conditioner will be turned off.


A smoke sensor will be installed inside the house. For the fire alarm condition, both the smoke sensor data and the temperature sensor data will be checked.
The fire alarm will be triggered if the data from the smoke sensor and temperature sensor has exceeded certain levels.
In the event of a fire alarm, a led on the microcontroller will flash, at the same time both the fire department will be searched by the application and an sms will be sent to the host to provide information.
